\title{Community matrix of the Mt. Mongón}
\format{
A dataframe with 100 sites (rows) and 69 species (columns). Species
  presence is given in percentage points (between 0-100% per species and
  site). Due to overlapping cover between individual plants, the total cover
  per site can be >100\%.
}
\description{
A community matrix with species as columns and sites as rows.
  The rownames correspond to the id which can be also found in
  [random_points]. Please note that in fact 100 sites have been visited but
  in 16 of them no species could be found (see again [random_points]).
